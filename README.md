# Grocery-List
The Grocery List program functions as an easy, electronified way to keep track of your grocery shopping list. It uses a plethora of if statements to allow the user to choose the option which best suits their interest at that time: ie choosing option 1 to add items to the list, etc. Make sure to put the number of the desired option as an input, and then put the name of the item you wish to add/revise/remove/etc. Worked on the first few options with Audrey Ringle.
