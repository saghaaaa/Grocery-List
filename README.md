# Grocery-List
I worked on this code with Audrey Ringle, who helped me create the first few functions. However, I finished it up and created the last few by myself as well as refined some of the code that we had done in the previous class.  It works as a grocery list (although you COULD add things unrelated to grocery, the primary function is for shopping.)
